Accessing the Quantstamp Assurance Protocol:

In using the compiled Software to access the Quantstamp Assurance Protocol (“Protocol”), you acknowledge and agree that you shall comply with the export laws and regulations of the United States and all other applicable jurisdictions in accessing the Protocol. Without limiting the foregoing, you warrant and represent that you and your wallet address are not named on any government list of persons or entities whose assets are blocked or who are prohibited from receiving exports, e.g., the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control’s Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List, as updated from time to time, and you shall not access the Protocol in violation of any laws of any applicable jurisdiction(s), including but not limited to any export, embargo, anti-terrorist financing/anti-money laundering prohibition, global standards endorsed by the Financial Action Task Force, or other restriction.

Use of the compiled Software to access the Protocol is at your sole risk.  You may risk loss of QSP, Ether, tokens, digital assets, or any other amounts.  Use of the compiled Software to operate a node and access the Protocol enables connectivity to the Ethereum platform, a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system and thus your interactions, information submitted, and resulting scan analyses are NOT private and instead they are publicly accessible as further described in the associated documentation.  In particular, any source code that you submit or scan results that you provide will be publicly accessible, storable, and stored by one or more entities throughout multiple jurisdictions.  If you do not want your information to be publicly accessible, discontinue use immediately.  You acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible for any disclosures, filings, payments, penalties, and/or other requirements in connection with QSP, Ether, tokens, digital assets, or any other amounts, including but not limited, to tax consequences. FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE SOFTWARE, NODE OPERATION, THE QUANTSTAMP PROTOCOL, AND ACCESS AND/OR USAGE THEREOF, INCLUDING ANY ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION, SERVICES, AND/OR MATERIALS, SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED OR RELIED UPON AS ANY FORM OF INVESTMENT PURPOSE OR OTHER VEHICLE WITH AN EXPECTATION TO EARN A PROFIT OR AS ANY FORM OF FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TAX, LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR OTHER ADVICE.
